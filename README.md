Hello friends.
This is a Visualizer for the classic problem N-Queens (LeetCode 51)

In this problem we use backtracking and recursion as the algorithm to solve the problem.

In this project you can view where Queens are placed and if Queens are placed in position where another Queens attacks , so there backTracking is done and all possible solutions are being found and displayed the result at the end

Thank you mates :)
